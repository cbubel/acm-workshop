# ACM workshop
Why you should consider using web technologies for the hackathon.

## Web tech is powerful
With web technologies, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can prototype (and build) applications at an incredibly fast pace, largely because there is a quick and low cost feedback loop while iterating over the design. The basic workflow is often: write some code, save, refresh the browser.

## Web tech is confusing
Web development has gotten way to complicated over the past few years. There are new terms/libraries/frameworks/ideas popping up every day. ES2015, Node, Express, NPM, Grunt, Gulp, Browserify, Bower, SystemJS, CommonJS, AMD, Webpack, Typescript, Elm, RequireJS, Angular, React, Aurelia, Vue, Ember, Backbone, Redux, Flux, Electron.

How do you stay up to date with all these technologies, what they do, and when they should be used? It takes a lot of practice and reading to get acquainted with the newest library, and this can be very intimidating for beginners.

So, why go through all the trouble? These technologies are incredibly powerful and make developing for the web a much, much better process, despite their own complexities.

## The goal
The goal of this workshop is to give you a small view into the chaotic world of modern web development. It is by no means the only way things can or should be done. If you use this setup, however, you'll have a very smooth development process, very conducive for rapid development.

## Requirements
- [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Webpack (installed via NPM)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- (Recommended) Visual Studio Code
